# Language Page

This is a webpage made to help none native English speakers learn *phrasal verbs* as it's something my students always have problems with.

## Linked Data

The file *questions_data.json* has the questions that are used in the quiz. More items can be added in at a later time without effecting the current code since the list length is used to choose a random question.

The data is laid out in the following format:

Key : Phrasal Verb, Example sentence 1, Example sentence 2, Answer 1, Answer 2.

## Known issues

* Since moving the correct answer to different radio buttons, it no longer displays correctly when the correct answer is selected.

* Wrong answers are listed as such. I plan to have these populated with answers from other questions soon, so its a less obvious incorrect answer.
